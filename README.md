# Personal Website

This repo contains files to my personal website, built in react native with the help of webpack, babel & tailwindcss (mostly because im too lazy to build components fuck off).

Feel free to steal this code and call it your own, just don't bother me, and don't dm me for help.

& this website uses [this theme](https://github.com/bluz71/vim-nightfly-guicolors). Go show some love people.
that's it for now, cya.
